## ✨ THE VIBE (Features)

*   **The Drama Box:** Type in your life problems, fashion fails, or that text from your ex.
*   **Aesthetic Mode:** Smooth lo-fi lounge vibes with polite, high-society sarcasm. Very posh, very mindful.
*   **Savage Mode (The Villain Arc):** The UI turns blood-red, the music turns into an anime villain theme, and the AI personally attacks your social standing. *Major Ick energy.*
*   **Mom Mode:** One click and the Gen-Z roast translates into a classic Desi Mom scolding. *“Phone chodo aur jaake kaam karo!”*
*   **Film Grain Aesthetic:** Every pixel is editorial. We don't do basic UI.
